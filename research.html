We develop algorithms for Secure and Safety Machine Learning Systems, especially the secure and safe foundation .

We are interested in developing machine learning techniques that enable AI agents to model the behaviors and goals of humans and other agents by leveraging different forms of information.
We specifically focus on learning from humans via multiple modes of information sources, including explicit forms such as human demonstrations and comparisons, and more implicit forms such as human gaze and gestures, to equip AI agents and robots with the capability to understand and align with humans' goals and preferences.
We also emphasize the importance of data-efficiency and expressiveness in learning and capturing humans' behaviors accurately.
We work on projects such as explainable reinforcement and imitation learning, modeling a belief over human preferences to tune it with their feedback, and developing active learning algorithms for data-efficient learning from comparisons.

<h2 class="h3">Multi-Agent Systems</h2>
<p><figure style="width:30%; float:right;"><img src="/images/research/multi-agent-systems.png" /><figcaption style="font-size:small; color:gray;">We study multi-agent systems ranging from two-player games to systems with thousands of robots and humans.</figcaption></figure>
Our work on multi-agent systems involves studying game-theoretic settings, and ensuring safety and efficiency in complex multi-agent environments.
By incorporating learning and adaptation strategies, we aim to create AI agents that can predict and coordinate with the other agents in the environment.
We have demonstrated the benefits of partner-aware agents in achieving better equilibria in canonical games and ensuring safety in multi-agent Markov decision processes.
We also investigate traffic optimization, showing that autonomous vehicles predicting human drivers' routing choices can help solve congestion problems and optimize pricing for ride-hailing or public transportation services.
